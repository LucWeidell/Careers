How I can be successful:

Resume: 
I want to both expand what I have learned at certain jobs but dont want to leave holes.
The way I have written it now (when it is done) is that it focuses highly on concision, but display the depth of
just my working history in geeral.

Interview:
With my concise resume I will need to expand upon that with my interview. But following STARs, also in addition
I think one of my strengths is my ability to improtu bring up my experiences, though maybe not with flowery language.
Also for me right before the interview listening to music calms my down.
